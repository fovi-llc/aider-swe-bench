#### Below is a real GitHub issue from a popular GitHub repository.  
#### The issue was filed some time ago.  
#### The repo has been checked out at the commit that existed at the moment the issue was filed.  
#### If you are already familiar with this repo, be cautious!  
#### You are working with an old version of the repo!  
#### Filenames, directory names, file contents, etc may be different than what you're used to.  
####   
#### Propose changes to update the repo to fix the problem below.  
####   
#### #expr.atoms() should return objects with no args instead of subclasses of Atom  
#### `expr.atoms()` with no arguments returns subclasses of `Atom` in `expr`. But the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`.   
####   
#### This should be easy to fix, but one needs to check that this doesn't affect the performance.

> Unexpected error: cannot access local variable 'exception_provider' where it is not associated with a value  

#### You haven't named any files in this repo.  
#### Remember, this repo is checked out at quite an old commit.  
#### So the file layout and contents may be unfamiliar.  
####   
#### Tell me: which 3-5 files from this repo should I look at to solve the problem?
