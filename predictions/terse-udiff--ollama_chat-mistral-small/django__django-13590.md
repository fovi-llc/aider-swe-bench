#### #Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.  
#### This project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.  
#### This happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.  
#### When it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.  
#### NamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.  
#### The fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to modify the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class within Django's SQL query module. Specifically, we need to ensure that when reconstructing tuples from iterators, the contents of the iterator are expanded into the constructor.

Here is the proposed change:

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```
from django.db.models.sql.query import Query

class Query:
    def resolve_lookup_value(self, value):
        if isinstance(value, tuple) and hasattr(value, '_fields'):
            # If the value is a namedtuple, expand its contents into the constructor
            return type(value)(*value)
        elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
            # If the value is a list or tuple, resolve each element recursively
            return [self.resolve_lookup_value(v) for v in value]
        else:
            return value

    def __init__(self, model):
        self.model = model
```

This change ensures that named tuples are correctly reconstructed by expanding their contents into the constructor. This should fix the `TypeError` encountered when upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0.

Please review this change and let me know if you need any further adjustments or additional information.
