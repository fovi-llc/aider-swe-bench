#### #Models migration with change field foreign to many and deleting unique together.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Simon Charette)  
#### 	   
#### I have models like  
#### class Authors(models.Model):  
#### 	project_data_set = models.ForeignKey(  
#### 		ProjectDataSet,  
#### 		on_delete=models.PROTECT  
#### 	)  
#### 	state = models.IntegerField()  
#### 	start_date = models.DateField()  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		 unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)  
#### and  
#### class DataSet(models.Model):  
#### 	name = models.TextField(max_length=50)  
#### class Project(models.Model):  
#### 	data_sets = models.ManyToManyField(  
#### 		DataSet,  
#### 		through='ProjectDataSet',  
#### 	)  
#### 	name = models.TextField(max_length=50)  
#### class ProjectDataSet(models.Model):  
#### 	"""  
#### 	Cross table of data set and project  
#### 	"""  
#### 	data_set = models.ForeignKey(DataSet, on_delete=models.PROTECT)  
#### 	project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.PROTECT)  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		unique_together = (('data_set', 'project'),)  
#### when i want to change field project_data_set in Authors model from foreign key field to many to many field I must delete a unique_together, cause it can't be on many to many field.  
#### Then my model should be like:  
#### class Authors(models.Model):  
#### 	project_data_set = models.ManyToManyField(  
#### 		ProjectDataSet,  
#### 	)  
#### 	state = models.IntegerField()  
#### 	start_date = models.DateField()  
#### But when I want to do a migrations.  
#### python3 manage.py makemigrations  
#### python3 manage.py migrate  
#### I have error:  
#### ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)  
#### The database is on production, so I can't delete previous initial migrations, and this error isn't depending on database, cause I delete it and error is still the same.  
#### My solve is to first delete unique_together, then do a makemigrations and then migrate. After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.  
#### But in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.  
#### I added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.

To address this issue, we need to handle the migration in a way that avoids the `ValueError` and ensures that the changes are applied correctly. The key steps involve:

1. Removing the `unique_together` constraint.
2. Changing the field from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField`.
3. Creating the necessary migrations.

Given the constraints of not being able to delete previous initial migrations, we need to carefully manage the migration process.

Here's how we can achieve this:

1. **Remove the `unique_together` constraint**: This will be done in a separate migration.
2. **Change the field type**: This will be done in another migration.
3. **Add back the `unique_together` constraint if needed**: This step is optional and depends on whether you need to enforce uniqueness at the database level after the change.

### Step 1: Remove the `unique_together` constraint

Create a new migration file to remove the `unique_together` constraint.

migrations/0002_remove_unique_together.py
```
from django.db import migrations

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('app_authors', '0001_initial'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(
            name='authors',
            unique_together=set(),
        ),
    ]
```

### Step 2: Change the field type from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`

Create another migration file to change the field type.

migrations/0003_change_field_type.py
```
from django.db import migrations, models

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('app_authors', '0002_remove_unique_together'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RemoveField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_set',
        ),
        migrations.AddField(
            model_name='authors',
            name='project_data_set',
            field=models.ManyToManyField(to='app_authors.ProjectDataSet'),
        ),
    ]
```

### Step 3: (Optional) Add back the `unique_together` constraint

If you need to enforce uniqueness at the database level after the change, you can add a new migration to re-add the `unique_together` constraint. However, note that `ManyToManyField` does not support `unique_together`.

### Updated Models

Update your models to reflect the changes.

models.py
```
from django.db import models

class DataSet(models.Model):
    name = models.TextField(max_length=50)

class Project(models.Model):
    data_sets = models.ManyToManyField(
        DataSet,
        through='ProjectDataSet',
    )
    name = models.TextField(max_length=50)

class ProjectDataSet(models.Model):
    """
    Cross table of data set and project
    """
    data_set = models.ForeignKey(DataSet, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
    project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.PROTECT)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('data_set', 'project'),)

class Authors(models.Model):
    project_data_set = models.ManyToManyField(
        ProjectDataSet,
    )
    state = models.IntegerField()
    start_date = models.DateField()

```

### Summary of Changes

1. **Remove the `unique_together` constraint**: This is done in `0002_remove_unique_together.py`.
2. **Change the field type**: This is done in `0003_change_field_type.py`.
3. **Update the models**: The models are updated to reflect the changes.

By following these steps, you should be able to migrate your database without encountering the `ValueError`.
