#### Below is a real GitHub issue from a popular GitHub repository.

#### You are working with an old version of the repo!

#### #Using __isnull=True on a KeyTransform should not match JSON null on SQLite and Oracle  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### The KeyTransformIsNull lookup borrows the logic from HasKey for isnull=False, which is correct. If isnull=True, the query should only match objects that do not have the key. The query is correct for MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. However, on SQLite and Oracle, the query also matches objects that have the key with the value null, which is incorrect.  
#### To confirm, edit tests.model_fields.test_jsonfield.TestQuerying.test_isnull_key. For the first assertion, change  
#### 		self.assertSequenceEqual(  
#### 			NullableJSONModel.objects.filter(value__a__isnull=True),  
#### 			self.objs[:3] + self.objs[5:],  
#### 		)  
#### to  
#### 		self.assertSequenceEqual(  
#### 			NullableJSONModel.objects.filter(value__j__isnull=True),  
#### 			self.objs[:4] + self.objs[5:],  
#### 		)  
#### The test previously only checks with value__a which could not catch this behavior because the value is not JSON null.

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to modify the query logic for SQLite and Oracle databases to ensure that `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup correctly handles JSON null values. Specifically, we need to update the test case to verify this behavior.

Here are the steps to fix the issue:

1. **Update the Query Logic**: Modify the query logic in the `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup to handle SQLite and Oracle databases correctly.
2. **Update the Test Case**: Update the test case to check for the correct behavior with JSON null values.

### Step 1: Update the Query Logic

We need to modify the `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup to ensure it handles JSON null values correctly for SQLite and Oracle. This involves checking the database backend and adjusting the query accordingly.

### Step 2: Update the Test Case

Update the test case to verify that the query behaves as expected with JSON null values.

Let's assume the relevant files are `django/db/models/lookups.py` for the lookup logic and `tests/model_fields/test_jsonfield.py` for the test case.

#### File: django/db/models/lookups.py
```python
from django.db.models import Lookup

class KeyTransformIsNull(Lookup):
    lookup_name = 'isnull'

    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        lhs, lhs_params = self.process_lhs(compiler, connection)
        rhs, rhs_params = self.process_rhs(compiler, connection)

        if connection.vendor == 'sqlite' or connection.vendor == 'oracle':
            # Adjust the query for SQLite and Oracle
            sql = f"{lhs} IS NULL"
        else:
            sql = f"JSON_EXTRACT({lhs}, '$[*]') IS NOT NULL"

        return sql, lhs_params + rhs_params

```

#### File: tests/model_fields/test_jsonfield.py
```python
from django.test import TestCase
from .models import NullableJSONModel

class TestQuerying(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.objs = [
            NullableJSONModel(value={'a': None}),
            NullableJSONModel(value={'a': 1}),
            NullableJSONModel(value={'b': 2}),
            NullableJSONModel(value={'c': 3}),
            NullableJSONModel(value=None),
            NullableJSONModel(value={})
        ]
        for obj in self.objs:
            obj.save()

    def test_isnull_key(self):
        # Test with value__a
        self.assertSequenceEqual(
            NullableJSONModel.objects.filter(value__a__isnull=True),
            self.objs[:3] + self.objs[5:],
        )

        # Test with value__j
        self.assertSequenceEqual(
            NullableJSONModel.objects.filter(value__j__isnull=True),
            self.objs[:4] + self.objs[5:],
        )
```

These changes should address the issue by ensuring that the `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup handles JSON null values correctly for SQLite and Oracle databases, and the test case verifies this behavior.

Understood. Please provide me with the specific changes or enhancements you would like to make to the files `tests/model_fields/test_jsonfield.py` and `django/db/models/lookups.py`. If you have any additional requirements or context, please include those as well.
