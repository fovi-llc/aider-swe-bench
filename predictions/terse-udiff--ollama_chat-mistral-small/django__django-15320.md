#### #Subquery.as_sql() generates invalid SQL.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by M1ha Shvn)  
#### 	   
#### Since â€‹this commit Subquery.as_sql(...) method returns incorrect SQL removing first and last symbols instead of absent breakets. Adding Subquery().query.subquery = True attribute fixes the problem. From my point of view, it should be set in Subquery constructor.  
#### from django.db import connection  
#### from apps.models import App  
#### q = Subquery(App.objects.all())  
#### print(str(q.query))  
#### # Output SQL is valid:  
#### # 'SELECT "apps_app"."id", "apps_app"."name" FROM "apps_app"'  
#### print(q.as_sql(q.query.get_compiler('default'), connection))  
#### # Outptut SQL is invalid (no S letter at the beggining and " symbol at the end):  
#### # ('(ELECT "apps_app"."id", "apps_app"."name" FROM "apps_app)', ())  
#### q.query.subquery = True  
#### print(q.as_sql(q.query.get_compiler('default'), connection))  
#### # Outputs correct result  
#### ('(SELECT "apps_app"."id", "apps_app"."name" FROM "apps_app")', ())

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to modify the `Subquery` class to ensure that the `subquery` attribute is set to `True` by default. This will prevent the generation of invalid SQL.

Here are the steps to fix the problem:

1. Locate the `Subquery` class definition.
2. Modify the constructor of the `Subquery` class to set the `subquery` attribute to `True`.

Assuming the `Subquery` class is defined in a file named `queryset.py`, here is the updated content of that file:

django/db/models/querysets.py
```
from django.db.models import QuerySet

class Subquery(QuerySet):
    def __init__(self, model=None, query=None, using=None, hints=None):
        super().__init__(model=model, query=query, using=using, hints=hints)
        self.query.subquery = True
```

This change ensures that the `subquery` attribute is set to `True` when a `Subquery` object is instantiated, which should fix the issue with the generated SQL.
