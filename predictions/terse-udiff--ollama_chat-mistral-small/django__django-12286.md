#### Below is a real GitHub issue from a popular GitHub repository.  
#### The issue was filed some time ago.  
#### The repo has been checked out at the commit that existed at the moment the issue was filed.  
#### If you are already familiar with this repo, be cautious!  
#### You are working with an old version of the repo!  
#### Filenames, directory names, file contents, etc may be different than what you're used to.

#### Propose changes to update the repo to fix the problem below.  
####   
#### #translation.E004 shouldn't be raised on sublanguages when a base language is available.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### According to Django documentation:  
#### If a base language is available but the sublanguage specified is not, Django uses the base language. For example, if a user specifies de-at (Austrian German) but Django only has de available, Django uses de.  
#### However, when using Django 3.0.2, if my settings.py has  
#### LANGUAGE_CODE = "de-at"  
#### I get this error message:  
#### SystemCheckError: System check identified some issues:  
#### ERRORS:  
#### ?: (translation.E004) You have provided a value for the LANGUAGE_CODE setting that is not in the LANGUAGES setting.  
#### If using  
#### LANGUAGE_CODE = "es-ar"  
#### Django works fine (es-ar is one of the translations provided out of the box).

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to modify the Django codebase to ensure that `translation.E004` is not raised when a sublanguage is specified but the base language is available.

Here are the steps and changes needed:

1. **Modify the System Check**: Update the system check logic to handle cases where a sublanguage is specified but the base language is available.
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure that the documentation reflects this behavior.

### Step 1: Modify the System Check

We need to update the system check in Django to handle the case where a sublanguage is specified but the base language is available. This involves modifying the `translation` module, specifically the part that raises `translation.E004`.

#### File: django/core/validators.py
```
# Add this import at the top of the file if it's not already there.
from django.utils.translation import get_language_info

def validate_language_code(value):
    """
    Validate that the language code is in the LANGUAGES setting.
    """
    from django.conf import settings
    languages = dict(settings.LANGUAGES)
    base_lang, _ = value.split('-') if '-' in value else (value, None)

    # Check if the exact language code or its base language is available
    if value not in languages and base_lang not in languages:
        raise ValidationError(
            'You have provided a value for the LANGUAGE_CODE setting that is not in the LANGUAGES setting.',
            code='translation.E004',
        )
```

### Step 2: Update Documentation

Ensure that the documentation reflects this behavior. This might involve updating the Django documentation to clarify how sublanguages are handled.

#### File: docs/ref/settings.rst
```
# Add or update the relevant section in the documentation.
LANGUAGE_CODE
-------------

Default: ``'en-us'``

A string representing the language code for this installation. This should be a valid language code, such as 'de', 'es-ar', etc.

If a sublanguage is specified but not available (e.g., 'de-at'), Django will use the base language (e.g., 'de') if it is available.
```

### Summary of Changes

1. **django/core/validators.py**: Updated to handle cases where a sublanguage is specified but the base language is available.
2. **docs/ref/settings.rst**: Updated documentation to reflect this behavior.

These changes should address the issue described in the GitHub issue and ensure that `translation.E004` is not raised when a base language is available for a specified sublanguage.

To fix the error `F821 undefined name 'ValidationError'`, we need to import the `ValidationError` class from `django.core.exceptions`.

Here is the updated content for the `django/core/validators.py` file:

#### File: django/core/validators.py
```
# Add this import at the top of the file if it's not already there.
from django.utils.translation import get_language_info

from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError  # Import ValidationError

def validate_language_code(value):
    """
    Validate that the language code is in the LANGUAGES setting.
    """
    from django.conf import settings
    languages = dict(settings.LANGUAGES)
    base_lang, _ = value.split('-') if '-' in value else (value, None)

    # Check if the exact language code or its base language is available
    if value not in languages and base_lang not in languages:
        raise ValidationError(
            'You have provided a value for the LANGUAGE_CODE setting that is not in the LANGUAGES setting.',
            code='translation.E004',
        )
```

Understood. Please provide me with the specific changes or enhancements you would like to make to `django/core/validators.py`. If you can describe the issue or feature request in detail, that would be very helpful.
