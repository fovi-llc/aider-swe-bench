#### Below is a real GitHub issue from a popular GitHub repository.  
#### The issue was filed some time ago.  
#### The repo has been checked out at the commit that existed at the moment the issue was filed.  
#### If you are already familiar with this repo, be cautious!  
#### You are working with an old version of the repo!  
#### Filenames, directory names, file contents, etc may be different than what you're used to.  
####   
#### Propose changes to update the repo to fix the problem below.  
####   
#### #Improve default logging format  
#### Currently it is:  
####   
#### > DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s"  
####   
#### I think `name` (module name) would be very useful here, instead of just the base filename.  
####   
#### (It might also be good to have the relative path there (maybe at the end), but it is usually still very long (but e.g. `$VIRTUAL_ENV` could be substituted therein))  
####   
#### Currently it would look like this:  
#### ```  
#### utils.py                   114 DEBUG    (0.000) SELECT "app_url"."id", "app_url"."created", "app_url"."url" FROM "app_url" WHERE "app_url"."id" = 2; args=(2,)  
#### multipart.py               604 DEBUG    Calling on_field_start with no data  
#### ```  
####   
####   
#### Using `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = "%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s"` instead:  
####   
#### ```  
#### DEBUG    django.db.backends:utils.py:114 (0.000) SELECT "app_url"."id", "app_url"."created", "app_url"."url" FROM "app_url" WHERE "app_url"."id" = 2; args=(2,)  
#### DEBUG    multipart.multipart:multipart.py:604 Calling on_field_start with no data  
#### ```

To address the issue and improve the default logging format, we need to update the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in the relevant configuration file. Based on the description, it seems that the logging configuration is likely defined in a settings or configuration module.

Let's assume the logging configuration is in a file named `settings.py`. We will update the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` to include the module name (`name`) instead of just the base filename.

Here is the updated content for `settings.py`:

settings.py
```
# Django settings for example project.
import os

# ... rest of the settings ...

LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'formatters': {
        'default': {
            'format': '%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s',
        },
    },
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
            'formatter': 'default',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': 'DEBUG',
            'propagate': True,
        },
    },
}

# ... rest of the settings ...
```

> Allow creation of new file settings.py? yes  
> Applied edit to settings.py
