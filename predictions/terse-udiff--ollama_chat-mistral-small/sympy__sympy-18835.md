#### Below is a real GitHub issue from a popular GitHub repository.  
#### The issue was filed some time ago.  
#### The repo has been checked out at the commit that existed at the moment the issue was filed.  
#### If you are already familiar with this repo, be cautious!  
#### You are working with an old version of the repo!  
#### Filenames, directory names, file contents, etc may be different than what you're used to.  
####   
#### Propose changes to update the repo to fix the problem below.  
####   
#### #uniq modifies list argument  
#### When you iterate over a dictionary or set and try to modify it while doing so you get an error from Python:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> multiset('THISTLE')  
#### {'T': 2, 'H': 1, 'I': 1, 'S': 1, 'L': 1, 'E': 1}  
#### >>> for i in _:  
#### ...   _.pop(i)  
#### ...  
#### 2  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  
#### RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration  
#### ```  
#### It would be good to do the same thing from within `uniq` because the output will silently be wrong if you modify a passed list:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> f=list('THISTLE')  
#### >>> for i in uniq(f):  
#### ...   f.remove(i)  
#### ...   i  
#### ...  
#### 'T'  
#### 'I'  
#### 'L'  
#### ```  
#### I think this would entail recording the size at the start and then checking the size and raising a similar RuntimeError if the size changes.

To address the issue where modifying a list while iterating over it can lead to unexpected behavior, we need to ensure that the `uniq` function checks for modifications to the input list. If the list is modified during iteration, we should raise a `RuntimeError`.

Here are the steps to implement this change:

1. Record the initial size of the list.
2. Check the size of the list before each iteration.
3. Raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes.

Let's assume the `uniq` function is defined in a file named `utils.py`. I will provide the updated content for this file.

utils.py
```
def uniq(seq):
    """Return a new sequence with duplicate elements removed."""
    seen = set()
    initial_size = len(seq)
    result = []
    for item in seq:
        if len(seq) != initial_size:
            raise RuntimeError("list modified during iteration")
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            result.append(item)
    return result
```

This change ensures that any modification to the list during iteration will be detected and an appropriate error will be raised.

> Allow creation of new file utils.py? yes  
> Applied edit to utils.py
