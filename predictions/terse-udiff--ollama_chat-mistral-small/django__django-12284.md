#### #Model.get_FOO_display() does not work correctly with inherited choices.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)  
#### 	   
#### Given a base model with choices A containing 3 tuples  
#### Child Model inherits the base model overrides the choices A and adds 2 more tuples  
#### get_foo_display does not work correctly for the new tuples added  
#### Example:  
#### class A(models.Model):  
####  foo_choice = [("A","output1"),("B","output2")]  
####  field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254,choices=foo_choice)  
####  class Meta:  
#### 	 abstract = True  
#### class B(A):  
####  foo_choice = [("A","output1"),("B","output2"),("C","output3")]  
####  field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254,choices=foo_choice)  
#### Upon invoking get_field_foo_display() on instance of B ,   
#### For value "A" and "B" the output works correctly i.e. returns "output1" / "output2"  
#### but for value "C" the method returns "C" and not "output3" which is the expected behaviour

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `get_foo_display` method in Django correctly handles inherited choices. The problem arises because Django's `get_FOO_display` method relies on the `choices` attribute defined in the model class. When a child model overrides the `choices`, it does not automatically update the display method for the parent model.

To resolve this, we can override the `get_foo_display` method in the child model to use the correct choices. Here is how you can do it:

1. Override the `get_foo_display` method in the child model.
2. Use the `choices` attribute from the child model to get the correct display value.

Let's update the models accordingly:

models.py
```
from django.db import models

class A(models.Model):
    foo_choice = [("A", "output1"), ("B", "output2")]
    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254, choices=foo_choice)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True

class B(A):
    foo_choice = [("A", "output1"), ("B", "output2"), ("C", "output3")]

    def get_field_foo_display(self):
        for value, display in self.foo_choice:
            if value == self.field_foo:
                return display
        return self.field_foo

    field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254, choices=foo_choice)
```

In this updated code:

- The `get_field_foo_display` method is overridden in the child model `B`.
- This method iterates over the `foo_choice` list and returns the correct display value for the given field value.

This should ensure that `get_field_foo_display()` works correctly for all values, including those added in the child model.
