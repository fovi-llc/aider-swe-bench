#### #Django throws error when different apps with different models have the same name table name.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Error message:  
#### table_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.  
#### We have a Base app that points to a central database and that has its own tables. We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.  
#### We have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.   
#### Is this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that Django can handle multiple models with the same table name across different apps. This behavior change was introduced in Django 2.2 to prevent potential conflicts and data integrity issues.

However, if you have a specific use case where this is necessary, you can override the default behavior by customizing the database router or using raw SQL queries. Below are the steps and changes needed to fix this issue:

1. **Create a Custom Database Router**: This will allow you to route database operations based on the app label.

2. **Update Models to Use Raw SQL Queries**: If necessary, you can use raw SQL queries to interact with the database directly.

### Step 1: Create a Custom Database Router

Create a new file `database_routers.py` in one of your apps (e.g., `base`) and add the following content:

base/database_routers.py
```
from django.conf import settings

class BaseRouter:
    """
    A router to control all database operations on models for the
    base app.
    """

    def db_for_read(self, model, **hints):
        if model._meta.app_label == 'base':
            return 'default'
        return None

    def db_for_write(self, model, **hints):
        if model._meta.app_label == 'base':
            return 'default'
        return None

    def allow_relation(self, obj1, obj2, **hints):
        if obj1._meta.app_label == 'base' or \
           obj2._meta.app_label == 'base':
            return True
        return None

    def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):
        if app_label == 'base':
            return db == 'default'
        return None
```

### Step 2: Update `settings.py` to Use the Custom Router

Update your `settings.py` file to include the custom router:

settings.py
```
# settings.py

DATABASE_ROUTERS = ['base.database_routers.BaseRouter']

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'central_db',
        'USER': 'your_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '',
    },
    # Add other databases here if needed
}
```

### Step 3: Update Models to Use Raw SQL Queries (if necessary)

If you need to use raw SQL queries for specific operations, you can do so in your models or views. Here is an example of how to use raw SQL queries:

models.py
```
from django.db import connection

def custom_query():
    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
        cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table_name")
        rows = cursor.fetchall()
        return rows
```

### Step 4: Update Your Views or Management Commands

If you have views or management commands that interact with the database, ensure they use the correct database router or raw SQL queries as needed.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue of having multiple models with the same table name across different apps in Django 2.2.
