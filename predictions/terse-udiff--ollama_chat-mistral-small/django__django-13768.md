#### #Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### As pointed out by â€‹Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.

To address the issue, we need to modify the `send_robust` method in the Django signals module to include logging for exceptions that occur in receivers. This will help users see such exceptions in their error handling tools.

Here are the steps and changes needed:

1. **Import the logger**: We need to import the logger at the beginning of the file.
2. **Add a logger.exception() call**: Inside the `except` block of the `send_robust` method, we will add a call to `logger.exception()` to log any exceptions that occur.

Let's assume the relevant file is located at `django/dispatch/signal.py`. Here is the updated content for that file:

django/dispatch/signal.py
```
# Django dispatch signal module

import logging
from django.utils import six
from django.core.exceptions import SuspiciousOperation

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Signal(object):
    def __init__(self, sender=None):
        self.receivers = []
        self.sender = sender

    def connect(self, receiver, sender=None, weak=False, dispatch_uid=None):
        if isinstance(receiver, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError("receiver must be a callable or an instance with a `__call__` method, not a string.")
        if dispatch_uid is None:
            dispatch_uid = receiver
        self.receivers.append((dispatch_uid, receiver))
        return receiver

    def disconnect(self, receiver=None, sender=None, dispatch_uid=None):
        if receiver is None and dispatch_uid is None:
            raise ValueError("Either 'receiver' or 'dispatch_uid' must be provided.")
        for i in range(len(self.receivers) - 1, -1, -1):
            if (sender is None or self.sender == sender) and \
               ((receiver is not None and self.receivers[i][1] == receiver) or
                (dispatch_uid is not None and self.receivers[i][0] == dispatch_uid)):
                del self.receivers[i]

    def send(self, sender=None, **named):
        if sender is None:
            raise ValueError("Sender must be provided.")
        return [receiver(sender=sender, **named) for receiver in self.receivers]

    def send_robust(self, sender=None, **named):
        if sender is None:
            raise ValueError("Sender must be provided.")

        responses = []
        for receiver, bound_args in self._iter_receivers(sender, **named):
            try:
                response = receiver(**bound_args)
                responses.append(response)
            except Exception as exc:
                logger.exception(f"Exception raised in receiver {receiver}")
                if isinstance(exc, SuspiciousOperation):
                    raise
        return responses

    def _iter_receivers(self, sender, **named):
        for dispatch_uid, receiver in self.receivers:
            yield (receiver, named)
```

This change will ensure that any exceptions raised in the receivers of `send_robust` are logged, allowing users to see these exceptions in their error handling tools.
