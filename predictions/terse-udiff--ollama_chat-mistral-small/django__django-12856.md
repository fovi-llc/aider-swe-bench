#### #Add check for fields of UniqueConstraints.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Marnanel Thurman)  
#### 	   
#### When a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check that the fields named therein actually exist.  
#### This is in contrast to the older unique_together syntax, which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.  
#### In the attached demonstration, you'll need to uncomment "with_unique_together" in settings.py in order to show that unique_together raises E012.

To address the issue of checking for fields in `UniqueConstraints`, we need to modify the migration generation process to ensure that the fields specified in `UniqueConstraint` actually exist. This involves adding validation logic similar to what is already present for `unique_together`.

Here are the steps and files that need to be updated:

1. **Update the `migrations/operations.py` file** to include a check for the existence of fields in `UniqueConstraints`.
2. **Update the `migrations/state.py` file** to ensure that the state reflects the changes correctly.

### File: django/db/migrations/operations.py
```python
# entire file content ...
from django.db import models

class UniqueConstraint(models.UniqueConstraint):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields = kwargs.get('fields', [])

    def deconstruct(self):
        name = self.name
        fields = self.fields
        return (
            'models.UniqueConstraint',
            [],
            {'name': name, 'fields': fields}
        )

class CreateModel(models.CreateModel):
    # ... rest of the code ...

    def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):
        # ... existing code ...
        for constraint in self.model._meta.constraints:
            if isinstance(constraint, models.UniqueConstraint):
                for field_name in constraint.fields:
                    if not hasattr(self.model, field_name):
                        raise ValueError(f"Field '{field_name}' does not exist on model '{self.model.__name__}'")
        # ... rest of the code ...
```

### File: django/db/migrations/state.py
```python
# entire file content ...

class ModelState(models.ModelBase):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self._constraints = []

    @property
    def constraints(self):
        return self._constraints

    def add_constraint(self, constraint):
        if isinstance(constraint, models.UniqueConstraint):
            for field_name in constraint.fields:
                if not hasattr(self.model_class(), field_name):
                    raise ValueError(f"Field '{field_name}' does not exist on model '{self.model_class().__name__}'")
        self._constraints.append(constraint)

    def remove_constraint(self, constraint):
        self._constraints.remove(constraint)
```

### File: django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
# entire file content ...

class MigrationRecorder(models.Model):
    # ... existing code ...
    def record_migration(self, app_label, migration_name):
        # ... existing code ...
        for constraint in model._meta.constraints:
            if isinstance(constraint, models.UniqueConstraint):
                for field_name in constraint.fields:
                    if not hasattr(model, field_name):
                        raise ValueError(f"Field '{field_name}' does not exist on model '{model.__name__}'")
        # ... existing code ...
```

These changes ensure that when a `UniqueConstraint` is added to a model, the migration process will check for the existence of the fields specified in the constraint. If any field does not exist, a `ValueError` will be raised, similar to how `unique_together` works.

Please review these changes and let me know if you need further adjustments or additional files updated.

To fix the errors reported by `flake8`, we need to ensure that all references to `models` and `model` are properly defined. This involves importing the necessary modules and ensuring that the context in which these variables are used is correct.

### File: django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
from django.db import models

class MigrationRecorder(models.Model):
    # ... existing code ...

    def record_migration(self, app_label, migration_name):
        from django.apps import apps
        model = apps.get_model(app_label, migration_name)
        for constraint in model._meta.constraints:
            if isinstance(constraint, models.UniqueConstraint):
                for field_name in constraint.fields:
                    if not hasattr(model, field_name):
                        raise ValueError(f"Field '{field_name}' does not exist on model '{model.__name__}'")
        # ... existing code ...
```

### File: django/db/migrations/state.py
```python
from django.db import models

class ModelState(models.ModelBase):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self._constraints = []

    @property
    def constraints(self):
        return self._constraints

    def add_constraint(self, constraint):
        if isinstance(constraint, models.UniqueConstraint):
            for field_name in constraint.fields:
                if not hasattr(self.model_class(), field_name):
                    raise ValueError(f"Field '{field_name}' does not exist on model '{self.model_class().__name__}'")
        self._constraints.append(constraint)

    def model_class(self):
        from django.apps import apps
        return apps.get_model(self.app_label, self.model_name)
```

These changes ensure that the necessary imports are in place and that the context for `models` and `model` is correctly defined. The `record_migration` method in `recorder.py` now properly retrieves the model using `apps.get_model`, and the `ModelState` class in `state.py` includes a method to retrieve the model class dynamically.

Please review these changes and let me know if you need further adjustments or additional files updated.
