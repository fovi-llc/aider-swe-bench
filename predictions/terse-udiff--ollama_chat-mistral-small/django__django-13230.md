#### #Add support for item_comments to syndication framework  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Add comments argument to feed.add_item() in syndication.views so that item_comments can be defined directly without having to take the detour via item_extra_kwargs .  
#### Additionally, comments is already explicitly mentioned in the feedparser, but not implemented in the view.

To address the issue, we need to modify the `syndication/views.py` file to add support for `item_comments` in the `feed.add_item()` method. This involves adding a `comments` argument to the `add_item` method and ensuring that it is properly handled.

Before making changes, I need to clarify a few points:

1. What is the current signature of the `add_item` method in `syndication/views.py`? Specifically, what arguments does it currently accept?
2. How is `item_extra_kwargs` used in the current implementation? Understanding this will help in determining how to integrate `comments` directly.
3. Are there any other dependencies or related methods that need to be updated to support `comments`?

Once I have this information, I can provide a more accurate solution.


#### You haven't named any files in this repo.  
#### Remember, this repo is checked out at quite an old commit.  
#### So the file layout and contents may be unfamiliar.  
####   
#### Tell me: which 3-5 files from this repo should I look at to solve the problem?

Based on the issue description, here are the files that should be examined to solve the problem:

1. **syndication/views.py**: This is where the `feed.add_item()` method is defined. We need to modify this method to accept a `comments` argument.
2. **syndication/feeds.py** or similar: This file likely contains the definition of the feed class and its methods, including how items are added to the feed. We need to ensure that the `comments` argument is properly handled here as well.
3. **tests/test_syndication.py**: This file contains tests for the syndication framework. We need to update or add tests to ensure that the new `comments` argument works correctly.

Additionally, if there are any utility or helper files that handle item extra keywords or similar functionality, those might also be relevant:

4. **syndication/utils.py** (if it exists): This file might contain utility functions related to syndication.
5. **syndication/models.py**: If the comments are stored in a database model, this file will need to be updated to reflect any changes.

Please provide the contents of these files so that I can suggest specific changes.
