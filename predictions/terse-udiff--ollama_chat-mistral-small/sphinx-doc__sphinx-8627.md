#### #autodoc isn't able to resolve struct.Struct type annotations  
#### **Describe the bug**  
#### If `struct.Struct` is declared in any type annotations, I get `class reference target not found: Struct`  
####   
#### **To Reproduce**  
#### Simple `index.rst`  
#### ```  
#### Hello World  
#### ===========  
####   
#### code docs  
#### =========  
####   
#### .. automodule:: helloworld.helloworld  
#### ```  
####   
#### Simple `helloworld.py`  
#### ```  
#### import struct  
#### import pathlib  
####   
#### def consume_struct(_: struct.Struct) -> None:  
####     pass  
####   
#### def make_struct() -> struct.Struct:  
####     mystruct = struct.Struct('HH')  
####     return mystruct  
####   
#### def make_path() -> pathlib.Path:  
####     return pathlib.Path()  
#### ```  
####   
#### Command line:  
#### ```  
#### python3 -m sphinx -b html docs/ doc-out -nvWT  
#### ```  
####   
#### **Expected behavior**  
#### If you comment out the 2 functions that have `Struct` type annotations, you'll see that `pathlib.Path` resolves fine and shows up in the resulting documentation. I'd expect that `Struct` would also resolve correctly.

To fix the issue where `struct.Struct` type annotations are not being resolved by Sphinx's autodoc, we need to ensure that Sphinx can correctly interpret and document these type annotations. This typically involves configuring Sphinx to recognize standard library types properly.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Ensure Sphinx is configured to handle standard library types**: We need to add `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension in the configuration file.
2. **Add a sys.path entry for the module**: This ensures that Sphinx can find and document the `struct.Struct` type.

Let's update the necessary files:

### 1. Update `conf.py`

We need to ensure that the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension is enabled and configure it to handle standard library types correctly.

docs/conf.py
```
# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'helloworld'
copyright = '2023, Your Name'
author = 'Your Name'

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release = '0.1'

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel',
    'sphinx.ext.intersphinx',
    'sphinx.ext.doctest',
    'sphinx.ext.todo'
]

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ['_templates']

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = []

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'alabaster'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ['_static']
```

### 2. Update `index.rst`

Ensure that the `automodule` directive is correctly pointing to the module.

docs/index.rst
```
Hello World
===========

code docs
=========

.. automodule:: helloworld.helloworld
   :members:
   :undoc-members:
   :show-inheritance:
```

### 3. Update `helloworld.py`

No changes are needed in the `helloworld.py` file as it is already correctly using type annotations.

These changes should ensure that Sphinx can resolve and document the `struct.Struct` type annotations correctly.

I need to edit these files:

- docs/conf.py
- doc/development/tutorials/examples/helloworld.py

Please add them to the chat.
