#### #Migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions fails for models recreated as a proxy.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)  
#### 	   
#### I am trying to update my project to Django 2.2. When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available ​here):  
#### django.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.  
#### It looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.  
#### I tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.  
#### I searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on ​django-users and was asked to report this here.

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that the migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` does not attempt to re-create already existing entries in the `auth_permission` table. This can be achieved by adding a check to see if the permission already exists before attempting to create it.

Here are the steps to fix the issue:

1. **Modify the migration file** to include a check for existing permissions.
2. **Create a new migration file** that handles the update of proxy permissions correctly.

### Step 1: Modify the Migration File

We need to modify the `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` migration file to include a check for existing permissions. This involves adding a conditional statement to avoid duplicate entries.

#### auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py
```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from django.db import migrations, models

def update_proxy_permissions(apps, schema_editor):
    Permission = apps.get_model('auth', 'Permission')
    ContentType = apps.get_model('contenttypes', 'ContentType')

    # List of proxy models and their corresponding permissions
    proxy_models = [
        ('app_label', 'model_name', 'codename'),
        # Add more proxy models as needed
    ]

    for app_label, model_name, codename in proxy_models:
        content_type = ContentType.objects.get(app_label=app_label, model=model_name)
        permission, created = Permission.objects.get_or_create(
            content_type=content_type,
            codename=codename,
            defaults={'name': f'Can {codename} {model_name}'}
        )
        if not created:
            print(f"Permission for {app_label}.{model_name} with codename '{codename}' already exists.")

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('auth', '0010_auto_20180828_1549'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(update_proxy_permissions),
    ]
```

### Step 2: Create a New Migration File

If the above modification does not resolve the issue, we may need to create a new migration file that handles the update of proxy permissions correctly.

#### auth/migrations/0012_fix_proxy_permissions.py
```
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from __future__ import unicode_literals

from django.db import migrations, models

def fix_proxy_permissions(apps, schema_editor):
    Permission = apps.get_model('auth', 'Permission')
    ContentType = apps.get_model('contenttypes', 'ContentType')

    # List of proxy models and their corresponding permissions
    proxy_models = [
        ('app_label', 'model_name', 'codename'),
        # Add more proxy models as needed
    ]

    for app_label, model_name, codename in proxy_models:
        content_type = ContentType.objects.get(app_label=app_label, model=model_name)
        permission, created = Permission.objects.get_or_create(
            content_type=content_type,
            codename=codename,
            defaults={'name': f'Can {codename} {model_name}'}
        )
        if not created:
            print(f"Permission for {app_label}.{model_name} with codename '{codename}' already exists.")

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('auth', '0011_update_proxy_permissions'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(fix_proxy_permissions),
    ]
```

### Summary

1. **Modify the existing migration file** `auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` to include a check for existing permissions.
2. **Create a new migration file** `auth/migrations/0012_fix_proxy_permissions.py` if the modification does not resolve the issue.

These changes should help prevent the `IntegrityError` by ensuring that duplicate entries are not created in the `auth_permission` table.
