#### #Wrong Derivative kind attribute  
#### I'm playing around with the `kind` attribute.  
####   
#### The following is correct:  
####   
#### ```  
#### from sympy import Integral, Derivative  
#### from sympy import MatrixSymbol  
#### from sympy.abc import x  
#### A = MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2)  
#### i = Integral(A, x)  
#### i.kind  
#### # MatrixKind(NumberKind)  
#### ```  
####   
#### This one is wrong:  
#### ```  
#### d = Derivative(A, x)  
#### d.kind  
#### # UndefinedKind  
#### ```

To address the issue where the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` is returning `UndefinedKind`, we need to ensure that the `Derivative` class properly defines and returns the correct kind. This involves modifying the `Derivative` class to handle the `kind` attribute similarly to how it is handled in the `Integral` class.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. **Modify the `Derivative` class** to include a `kind` attribute that returns the appropriate kind.
2. **Ensure the `kind` attribute** is correctly defined and returned for matrix derivatives.

Let's assume the relevant files are located in the `sympy/core/relational.py` and `sympy/matrices/expressions/matrixexpr.py`.

### sympy/core/relational.py
```python
from sympy.core.basic import Basic
from sympy.core.sympify import _sympify

class Derivative(Basic):
    def __new__(cls, expr, *symbols, **assumptions):
        # Existing initialization code...
        obj = Basic.__new__(cls)
        obj._expr = expr
        obj._symbols = symbols
        return obj

    @property
    def kind(self):
        from sympy.core.kind import DerivativeKind
        return DerivativeKind()

# Rest of the file content...
```

### sympy/matrices/expressions/matrixexpr.py
```python
from sympy.core.relational import Derivative
from sympy.matrices.expr import MatrixExpr

class MatrixDerivative(MatrixExpr, Derivative):
    def __new__(cls, expr, *symbols, **assumptions):
        # Existing initialization code...
        obj = Basic.__new__(cls)
        obj._expr = expr
        obj._symbols = symbols
        return obj

    @property
    def kind(self):
        from sympy.core.kind import MatrixKind
        return MatrixKind()

# Rest of the file content...
```

### sympy/core/kind.py
```python
from sympy.core.basic import Basic

class DerivativeKind(Basic):
    pass

class MatrixKind(Basic):
    pass

# Rest of the file content...
```

These changes ensure that the `Derivative` class and its matrix-specific subclass `MatrixDerivative` correctly define and return the appropriate kind attribute. This should resolve the issue where the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` is returning `UndefinedKind`.

To fix the error `F821 undefined name 'Basic'`, we need to ensure that the `Basic` class is imported in the `sympy/matrices/expressions/matrixexpr.py` file. This will resolve the issue where `Basic` is not recognized.

### sympy/matrices/expressions/matrixexpr.py
```
from sympy.core.basic import Basic
from sympy.core.relational import Derivative
from sympy.matrices.expr import MatrixExpr

class MatrixDerivative(MatrixExpr, Derivative):
    def __new__(cls, expr, *symbols, **assumptions):
        # Existing initialization code...
        obj = Basic.__new__(cls)
        obj._expr = expr
        obj._symbols = symbols
        return obj

    @property
    def kind(self):
        from sympy.core.kind import MatrixKind
        return MatrixKind()

# Rest of the file content...
```
