#### Below is a real GitHub issue from a popular GitHub repository.  
#### The issue was filed some time ago.  
#### The repo has been checked out at the commit that existed at the moment the issue was filed.  
#### If you are already familiar with this repo, be cautious!  
#### You are working with an old version of the repo!  
#### Filenames, directory names, file contents, etc may be different than what you're used to.  
####   
#### Propose changes to update the repo to fix the problem below.  
####   
#### #Latex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec  
#### For example  
#### `latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style="full")` works as expected returning `'\\arcsin{\\left (x \\right )}'`  
#### But `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style="full")` gives `'\\operatorname{acsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'` instead of `'\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'`  
####   
#### A fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from  
#### `inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acot"]` to  
#### `inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acsc", "asec", "acot"]`
