#### #"default.html" deprecation warning raised for ManagementForm's  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I have a project where I never render forms with the {{ form }} expression. However, I'm still getting the new template deprecation warning because of the formset management form production, during which the template used is insignificant (only hidden inputs are produced).  
#### Is it worth special-casing this and avoid producing the warning for the management forms?

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to modify the code to special-case the management forms and avoid producing the deprecation warning for them. This involves checking if the form is a management form before rendering it with the `{{ form }}` expression.

First, let's identify the relevant files and functions that handle form rendering in Django. Typically, this would involve modifying the template rendering logic to check for management forms.

Since the specific file paths and function names are not provided, I'll assume some common locations based on typical Django projects. If these assumptions are incorrect, please provide the correct file paths and function names.

### Assumptions:
1. The form rendering logic is in a custom template tag or filter.
2. The management form check can be added to avoid the deprecation warning.

Let's assume the relevant code is in a file named `custom_tags.py` within a `templatetags` directory.

### Proposed Changes:

#### 1. Modify the custom template tag to check for management forms.

custom_tags.py
```
from django import template

register = template.Library()

@register.simple_tag(takes_context=True)
def render_form(context, form):
    if hasattr(form, 'management_form') and form.management_form:
        # Skip rendering the management form to avoid deprecation warning
        return ''
    else:
        return form.as_p()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Check for Management Form**: The `render_form` template tag now checks if the form is a management form by looking for the `management_form` attribute.
2. **Avoid Rendering**: If the form is a management form, it returns an empty string to avoid rendering it and triggering the deprecation warning.

### Additional Steps:

If the form rendering logic is handled differently in your project (e.g., directly in views or other template tags), you may need to adjust the changes accordingly. Please provide the specific file paths and function names if the assumptions are incorrect.

Please review these changes and let me know if you need further adjustments or additional files modified.
