#### #Bug: maximum recusion depth error when checking is_zero of cosh expression  
#### The following code causes a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object` error when checked if it is zero:  
#### ```  
#### expr =sympify("cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i)))")  
#### expr.is_zero  
#### ```

To address the `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object` error when checking if a `cosh` expression is zero, we need to ensure that the `is_zero` method in SymPy does not enter an infinite recursion loop. This issue likely arises from the complex interactions between hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions.

To fix this, we can add a check to detect cycles in the expression before attempting to simplify it further. We will modify the `is_zero` method to include this check.

Here is the proposed change:

sympy/core/expr.py
```
from __future__ import print_function

import itertools
import operator
import sys
import warnings

from sympy.core.compatibility import iterable, range
from sympy.core.basic import Basic
from sympy.core.cache import cacheit
from sympy.core.evalf import EvalfMixin
from sympy.core.mul import Mul
from sympy.core.power import Pow
from sympy.core.sympify import SympifyError, sympify
from sympy.logic.boolalg import BooleanAtom
from sympy.utilities.iterables import iterable

class Expr(Basic):
    """
    The base class for all expressions.

    This is the base class for all SymPy objects. It provides basic functionality
    that is common to all expressions, such as simplification and evaluation.
    """

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if len(args) == 1:
            arg = args[0]
            if isinstance(arg, Expr):
                return arg

        obj = Basic.__new__(cls)
        obj._args = tuple(sympify(a) for a in args)

        # Check for cycles
        def has_cycle(expr):
            seen = set()
            while expr:
                if id(expr) in seen:
                    return True
                seen.add(id(expr))
                expr = expr.args[0] if expr.args else None
            return False

        if has_cycle(obj):
            raise ValueError("Expression contains a cycle")

        return obj

    def is_zero(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Check whether the expression evaluates to zero.

        This method checks whether the expression simplifies to zero.
        """
        # Check for cycles before simplification
        if self.has_cycle():
            return False

        return super().is_zero(*args, **kwargs)

    def has_cycle(self):
        seen = set()
        expr = self
        while expr:
            if id(expr) in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(id(expr))
            expr = expr.args[0] if expr.args else None
        return False

# ... rest of the file ...
```

This change adds a `has_cycle` method to detect cycles in the expression and modifies the `is_zero` method to check for cycles before attempting to simplify the expression. If a cycle is detected, it returns `False`, preventing the recursion error.

Additionally, we add a check in the `__new__` method to raise an error if a cycle is detected during the creation of an expression.

Please review these changes and let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
