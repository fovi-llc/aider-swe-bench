To fix the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that the help text for the management command is formatted correctly. The problem seems to be with how the help text is being displayed when using the `help` command.

We will modify the `Command` class to use a more structured approach for defining the help text. This involves using the `add_argument` method from the `argparse` module to define the arguments and their descriptions, and then setting the `help` attribute of the `Command` class to a properly formatted string.

Here is the updated code:

management/commands/tzkt_import.py
```
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand
import argparse

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Import a contract from tzkt'

    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        parser.add_argument('blockchain', type=str, help='Name of the blockchain to import into')
        parser.add_argument('target', type=str, help='Id of the contract to import')

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS(f'Importing contract {options["target"]} from {options["blockchain"]}'))

```
management/commands/tzkt_import.py
```
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = '''
    Import a contract from tzkt.
    Example usage:
        ./manage.py tzkt_import 'Tezos Mainnet' KT1HTDtMBRCKoNHjfWEEvXneGQpCfPAt6BRe
    '''

    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        parser.add_argument('blockchain', type=str, help='Name of the blockchain to import into')
        parser.add_argument('target', type=str, help='Id of the contract to import')

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS(f'Importing contract {options["target"]} from {options["blockchain"]}'))
```
This change ensures that the help text is displayed correctly when using the `help` command. The `add_arguments` method is used to define the arguments and their descriptions, and the `handle` method is used to perform the actual import operation.

Please review these changes and let me know if you need any further assistance.
