#### #is_upper() raises IndexError for tall matrices  
#### The function Matrix.is_upper raises an IndexError for a 4x2 matrix of zeros.  
#### ```  
#### >>> sympy.zeros(4,2).is_upper  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>

####     raise IndexError("Index out of range: a[%s]" % (j,))  
#### IndexError: Index out of range: a[2]

####         return all(self[i, j].is_zero  
####                    for i in range(1, self.rows)  
####                    for j in range(i))  
#### ```  
#### For a 4x2 matrix, is_upper iterates over the indices:  
#### ```  
#### >>> A = sympy.zeros(4, 2)  
#### >>> print tuple([i, j] for i in range(1, A.rows) for j in range(i))  
#### ([1, 0], [2, 0], [2, 1], [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2])  
#### ```  
#### The attempt to index the (3,2) entry appears to be the source of the error.

To fix the `IndexError` in the `is_upper()` method for tall matrices (where the number of rows is greater than the number of columns), we need to ensure that the indices used to access matrix elements do not exceed the bounds of the matrix.

The current implementation iterates over all possible indices `(i, j)` where `j < i`, but this can lead to an out-of-range error when `i` exceeds the number of columns. We need to adjust the iteration to ensure that `j` is always within the valid range of column indices.

Here is the updated code for the `is_upper()` method:

sympy/matrices/matrices.py
```
from sympy.core.sympify import _sympify

class MatrixBase(object):
    # ... (other methods and properties)

    def is_upper(self):
        """
        Return True if self is an upper triangular matrix.
        An upper triangular matrix has all elements below the main diagonal equal to zero.

        Examples
        ========

        >>> from sympy import zeros, ones
        >>> M = zeros(3)
        >>> M.is_upper()
        True
        >>> N = ones(3)
        >>> N.is_upper()
        False
        """
        return all(self[i, j].is_zero for i in range(1, self.rows) for j in range(min(i, self.cols)))

    # ... (other methods and properties)

# ... (rest of the file)
```

In this updated code, the `range` function for `j` is adjusted to `min(i, self.cols)`, ensuring that `j` does not exceed the number of columns. This prevents the `IndexError` by keeping the indices within valid bounds.

Please review and test this change in your environment to ensure it resolves the issue as expected.
