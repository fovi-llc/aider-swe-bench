#### #Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Simon Kern)  
#### 	   
#### Accessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field="uuid") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:  
#### .../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid  
#### However the underlying form looks like this:   
#### Code highlighting:  
#### class UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):  
#### 	password = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(  
#### 		label=_("Password"),  
#### 		help_text=_(  
#### 			"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this "  
#### 			"user’s password, but you can change the password using "  
#### 			'<a href="{}">this form</a>.'  
#### 		),  
#### 	)  
#### 	...  
#### 	...  
#### 	def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):  
#### 		super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)  
#### 		password = self.fields.get("password")  
#### 		if password:  
#### 			password.help_text = password.help_text.format("../password/")  
#### 	...  
#### 	...  
#### This results in the link to the PasswordResetForm being wrong and thus ending up in a 404. If we drop the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its pk, then we're good to go. It's as simple as replacing password.help_text = password.help_text.format("../password/") with password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/")

To fix the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to update the `UserChangeForm` class to correctly generate the URL for the password reset form. The current implementation assumes that the UserAdmin is always accessed via its primary key (`pk`), but this assumption fails when accessing via a different field like `uuid`.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Update the `UserChangeForm` class to dynamically generate the correct URL based on the instance's primary key.

Let's assume the file containing the `UserChangeForm` class is located at `path/to/forms.py`. Here is the updated content of that file:

path/to/forms.py
```
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import ReadOnlyPasswordHashField

class UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):
    password = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(
        label=_("Password"),
        help_text=_(
            "Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this "
            "user’s password, but you can change the password using "
            '<a href="{}">this form</a>.'
        ),
    )

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        password = self.fields.get("password")
        if password:
            # Dynamically generate the URL based on the instance's primary key
            password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/")

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = '__all__'
```

To fix the errors reported by `flake8`, we need to import the necessary modules and ensure that all names are defined. Specifically, we need to import the `_` function from `django.utils.translation` for translation and the `User` model from the appropriate module.

Here is the updated content of `path/to/forms.py`:

path/to/forms.py
```
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth.forms import ReadOnlyPasswordHashField
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):
    password = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(
        label=_("Password"),
        help_text=_(
            "Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this "
            "user’s password, but you can change the password using "
            '<a href="{}">this form</a>.'
        ),
    )

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        password = self.fields.get("password")
        if password:
            # Dynamically generate the URL based on the instance's primary key
            password.help_text = password.help_text.format(f"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/")

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = '__all__'
```
