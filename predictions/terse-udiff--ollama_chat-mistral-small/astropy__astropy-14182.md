#### ===== ========  
####  wave response  
#### ===== ========  
#### 350.0      0.7  
#### 950.0      1.2  
#### ===== ========  
#### >>> tbl.write(sys.stdout,  format="ascii.fixed_width", header_rows=["name", "unit"])

####   
#### RestructuredText output is a great way to fill autogenerated documentation with content, so having this flexible makes the life easier `:-)`

To support header rows in RestructuredText output for the `astropy.table.QTable` class, we need to modify the `RST` writer class to handle the `header_rows` parameter. This involves updating the `RST` class to accept and process the `header_rows` argument.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Modify the `RST` class in the `astropy.io.ascii.core` module to accept the `header_rows` parameter.
2. Update the `write` method to handle the `header_rows` parameter and include it in the output.

Let's start by updating the `RST` class to accept the `header_rows` parameter:

astropy/io/ascii/core.py
```
from astropy.io.ascii.core import RST

class RST(RST):
    def __init__(self, header_rows=None, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.header_rows = header_rows

    def write(self, table, filename, **kwargs):
        if self.header_rows:
            for row in self.header_rows:
                print(row)

        # Call the original write method
        super().write(table, filename, **kwargs)

```

Next, we need to update the `get_writer` function in the `astropy.io.ascii.ui` module to pass the `header_rows` parameter to the `RST` class:

astropy/io/ascii/ui.py
```
from astropy.io.ascii.core import RST

def get_writer(Writer=None, fast_writer=False, **kwargs):
    if Writer is None:
        Writer = RST

    writer_kwargs = kwargs.copy()
    header_rows = writer_kwargs.pop('header_rows', None)

    writer = core._get_writer(Writer, fast_writer, **writer_kwargs)
    if isinstance(writer, RST) and header_rows is not None:
        writer.header_rows = header_rows
    return writer

```

Finally, we need to update the `write` method in the `astropy.io.ascii.ui` module to pass the `header_rows` parameter when calling the `get_writer` function:

astropy/io/ascii/ui.py
```
def write(table, filename, **kwargs):
    writer = get_writer(**kwargs)
    return writer.write(table, filename)

```

With these changes, the `RST` writer should now support the `header_rows` parameter and include it in the output. This will allow users to specify header rows when writing tables in RestructuredText format.

Please review these changes and let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

To fix the error `F821 undefined name 'core'`, we need to import the `core` module from `astropy.io.ascii`. Additionally, we should ensure that all necessary imports are present and correctly referenced.

Here is the updated content for `astropy/io/ascii/ui.py`:

astropy/io/ascii/ui.py
```
from astropy.io.ascii.core import RST, core

def get_writer(Writer=None, fast_writer=False, **kwargs):
    if Writer is None:
        Writer = RST

    writer_kwargs = kwargs.copy()
    header_rows = writer_kwargs.pop('header_rows', None)

    writer = core._get_writer(Writer, fast_writer, **writer_kwargs)
    if isinstance(writer, RST) and header_rows is not None:
        writer.header_rows = header_rows
    return writer

def write(table, filename, **kwargs):
    writer = get_writer(**kwargs)
    return writer.write(table, filename)

```

This should resolve the `F821` error by ensuring that the `core` module is properly imported.
