#### #[Bug]: Attribute Error combining matplotlib 3.7.1 and mplcursor on data selection  
#### ### Bug summary  
####   
#### If you combine mplcursor and matplotlib 3.7.1, you'll get an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'` after clicking a few data points. Henceforth, selecting a new data point will trigger the same traceback. Otherwise, it works fine.   
####   
#### ### Code for reproduction  
####   
#### ```python  
#### import numpy as np  
#### import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
#### import mplcursors as mpl  
####   
#### x = np.arange(1, 11)      
#### y1 = x  
####   
#### plt.scatter(x,y1)  
####   
#### mpl.cursor()  
#### plt.show()  
#### ```  
####   
####   
#### ### Actual outcome  
####   
#### ```  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "C:\Users\MrAni\Python\miniconda3\lib\site-packages\matplotlib\cbook\__init__.py", line 304, in process

####     canvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas)  
#### AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'  
#### ```  
####   
#### ### Expected outcome  
####   
#### No terminal output  
####   
#### ### Additional information  
####   
#### Using matplotlib 3.7.0 or lower works fine. Using a conda install or pip install doesn't affect the output.   
####   
#### ### Operating system

To address the issue described in the GitHub bug report, we need to ensure that `mplcursor` is compatible with `matplotlib 3.7.1`. The error suggests that there might be an issue with how `mplcursor` interacts with the canvas object in `matplotlib`.

Given the information provided, it seems like the issue might be related to how `mplcursor` handles the canvas reference. One potential solution is to update `mplcursor` to handle the canvas reference more robustly.

Since I don't have access to the actual codebase of `mplcursor`, I can suggest a general approach to fix this issue. However, without the actual source code, I cannot provide specific file listings. Here's a general approach:

1. **Update `mplcursor`**: Ensure that `mplcursor` is updated to handle the canvas reference correctly.
2. **Patch `mplcursor`**: If an update is not available, you might need to patch `mplcursor` to fix the issue.

### General Approach

1. **Check for Updates**:
   - First, check if there is an updated version of `mplcursor` that fixes this issue.
   - You can do this by checking the [mplcursor GitHub repository](https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors) or its PyPI page.

2. **Patch `mplcursor`**:
   - If no update is available, you might need to patch `mplcursor` yourself.
   - The error traceback suggests that the issue is in the `offsetbox.py` file of `matplotlib`. You might need to modify how `mplcursor` interacts with this file.

### Example Patch

If you need to patch `mplcursor`, you can do something like this:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mplcursors as mpl

x = np.arange(1, 11)
y1 = x

plt.scatter(x,y1)

# Patch mplcursor to handle the canvas reference correctly
def patched_cursor():
    cursor = mpl.cursor()
    # Add any necessary patches here
    return cursor

patched_cursor()
plt.show()
```

### Steps to Apply the Patch

1. **Clone the `mplcursor` Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors.git
   cd mplcursors
   ```

2. **Apply the Patch**:
   - Modify the relevant files in the `mplcursors` repository to handle the canvas reference correctly.
   - For example, you might need to modify the `cursor.py` file to ensure that the canvas reference is always valid.

3. **Install the Patched Version**:
   ```sh
   pip install .
   ```

### Example Patch for `cursor.py`

Here's an example of how you might patch the `cursor.py` file:

```python
# mplcursors/cursor.py

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.offsetbox import OffsetBox, AnnotationBbox

class Cursor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.canvas = None  # Initialize canvas to None

    def connect(self, ax):
        self.ax = ax
        self.canvas = ax.figure.canvas  # Ensure canvas is set correctly

    def disconnect(self):
        if self.canvas:
            self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self.cid)
```

### Conclusion

Without the actual source code of `mplcursor`, I cannot provide specific file listings. However, the general approach outlined above should help you address the issue. If you have access to the `mplcursor` source code, you can apply similar patches to ensure that the canvas reference is handled correctly.

If you provide the relevant files from the `mplcursor` repository, I can give more specific instructions on how to patch them.

Understood. Since I don't have access to the actual `mplcursor` source code, I can provide a hypothetical example of how you might patch the `cursor.py` file based on the information provided.

Let's assume the `cursor.py` file looks something like this:

### Original `cursor.py`

```python
# mplcursors/cursor.py

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.offsetbox import OffsetBox, AnnotationBbox

class Cursor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.canvas = None  # Initialize canvas to None

    def connect(self, ax):
        self.ax = ax
        self.canvas = ax.figure.canvas  # Ensure canvas is set correctly

    def disconnect(self):
        if self.canvas:
            self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self.cid)
```

### Patched `cursor.py`

To address the issue, you might need to ensure that the canvas reference is always valid. Here's a hypothetical patch:

```python
# mplcursors/cursor.py

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.offsetbox import OffsetBox, AnnotationBbox

class Cursor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.canvas = None  # Initialize canvas to None

    def connect(self, ax):
        self.ax = ax
        self.canvas = ax.figure.canvas  # Ensure canvas is set correctly
        if self.canvas is None:
            raise ValueError("Canvas reference is not valid")

    def disconnect(self):
        if self.canvas:
            try:
                self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self.cid)
            except AttributeError:
                print("Canvas or cid is not available for disconnection")
```

### File Listing

Here is the file listing for the patched `cursor.py`:

```python
mplcursors/cursor.py
```
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.offsetbox import OffsetBox, AnnotationBbox

class Cursor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.canvas = None  # Initialize canvas to None

    def connect(self, ax):
        self.ax = ax
        self.canvas = ax.figure.canvas  # Ensure canvas is set correctly
        if self.canvas is None:
            raise ValueError("Canvas reference is not valid")

    def disconnect(self):
        if self.canvas:
            try:
                self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(self.cid)
            except AttributeError:
                print("Canvas or cid is not available for disconnection")
```
```

### Steps to Apply the Patch

1. **Clone the `mplcursor` Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/anntzer/mplcursors.git
   cd mplcursors
   ```

2. **Apply the Patch**:
   - Modify the `cursor.py` file as shown above.

3. **Install the Patched Version**:
   ```sh
   pip install .
   ```

### Conclusion

This hypothetical patch ensures that the canvas reference is always valid and handles cases where the canvas or `cid` might not be available. If you have access to the actual `mplcursor` source code, you can apply similar patches to ensure compatibility with `matplotlib 3.7.1`.

If you provide the relevant files from the `mplcursor` repository, I can give more specific instructions on how to patch them.

To address the issue with the canvas reference in the `mplcursors` repository, we need to identify the key files that handle the cursor functionality and the interaction with the matplotlib canvas. Based on typical structures of such repositories, the following files are likely to be relevant:

1. **`cursor.py`**: This file is central to the cursor functionality and will likely contain the logic for connecting and disconnecting from the canvas.
2. **`mplcursors.py`**: This file might contain the main entry points and initialization code for `mplcursors`.
3. **`highlighters.py`**: This file could handle highlighting functionality, which might interact with the canvas.
4. **`annotations.py`**: This file might deal with annotations, which also interact with the canvas.

Let's start by examining these files to understand where changes might be needed. Please provide the contents of these files so I can suggest specific changes.
