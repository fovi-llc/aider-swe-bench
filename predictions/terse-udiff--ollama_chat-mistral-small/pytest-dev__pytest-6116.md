To implement a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` command in `pytest`, we need to modify the `pytest` command-line interface to recognize this shortcut. Typically, such changes involve updating the `pytest` configuration and parsing logic.

Since I don't have access to the specific files or the exact version of the repository you're referring to, I'll provide a general approach based on common practices in Python projects. This will include:

1. Adding a new command-line option for the shortcut.
2. Updating the help documentation to reflect this change.

Let's assume the relevant file is `pytest/main.py` and it contains the command-line parsing logic. We will add a new option `-c` for `--collect-only`.

### Updated File: pytest/main.py
```python
import argparse

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='PyTest')
    parser.add_argument('-c', '--collect-only', action='store_true',
                        help='only collect tests without executing them')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.collect_only:
        # Logic to handle --collect-only
        print("Collecting tests only...")
    else:
        # Regular pytest logic
        print("Running tests...")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Updated File: pytest/help.py
```python
def show_help():
    help_text = """
Usage: pytest [options] [file_or_dir] [file_or_dir] ...

Options:
  -c, --collect-only   only collect tests without executing them

For more details, see the documentation at https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/
"""
    print(help_text)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    show_help()
```

### New File: pytest/shortcuts.py
```python
def add_shortcut_option(parser):
    parser.add_argument('-c', '--collect-only', action='store_true',
                        help='only collect tests without executing them')
```

### Updated File: pytest/cli.py
```python
import argparse

from .main import main as pytest_main
from .shortcuts import add_shortcut_option

def cli():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='PyTest CLI')
    add_shortcut_option(parser)

    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.collect_only:
        # Logic to handle --collect-only
        print("Collecting tests only...")
    else:
        pytest_main()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cli()
```

### Updated File: pytest/__init__.py
```python
from .cli import cli

def main():
    cli()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

These changes add a new command-line option `-c` as a shortcut for `--collect-only`. The `add_shortcut_option` function is used to keep the code modular and easy to maintain. The help documentation is also updated to reflect this new option.

Please review these changes and adjust the file paths and names according to your specific repository structure. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
