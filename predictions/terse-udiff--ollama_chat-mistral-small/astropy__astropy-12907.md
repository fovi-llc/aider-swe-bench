#### #Modeling's `separability_matrix` does not compute separability correctly for nested CompoundModels  
#### Consider the following model:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### from astropy.modeling import models as m  
#### from astropy.modeling.separable import separability_matrix  
####   
#### cm = m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)  
#### ```  
####   
#### It's separability matrix as you might expect is a diagonal:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### >>> separability_matrix(cm)  
#### array([[ True, False],  
####        [False,  True]])  
#### ```  
####   
#### If I make the model more complex:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5))  
#### array([[ True,  True, False, False],  
####        [ True,  True, False, False],  
####        [False, False,  True, False],  
####        [False, False, False,  True]])  
#### ```  
####   
#### The output matrix is again, as expected, the outputs and inputs to the linear models are separable and independent of each other.  
####   
#### If however, I nest these compound models:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> separability_matrix(m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm)  
#### array([[ True,  True, False, False],  
####        [ True,  True, False, False],  
####        [False, False,  True,  True],  
####        [False, False,  True,  True]])  
#### ```  
#### Suddenly the inputs and outputs are no longer separable?  
####   
#### This feels like a bug to me, but I might be missing something?

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to ensure that the `separability_matrix` function correctly computes separability for nested `CompoundModels`. The problem seems to be related to how the separability matrix is constructed when models are nested.

Here's a step-by-step approach to fix this issue:

1. **Understand the Current Implementation**: We need to review the current implementation of the `separability_matrix` function to identify where it might be failing for nested models.
2. **Modify the Function**: Update the function to correctly handle nested models by ensuring that the separability matrix is constructed recursively.

Let's assume the relevant file is `astropy/modeling/separable.py`. We will need to modify the `separability_matrix` function to handle nested models correctly.

### astropy/modeling/separable.py
```
from __future__ import division, print_function

import numpy as np
from .core import Model
from .separable import SeparableModel

def separability_matrix(model):
    """
    Compute the separability matrix for a given model.
    """
    if isinstance(model, CompoundModel):
        # Recursively compute the separability matrix for each sub-model
        sub_matrices = [separability_matrix(sub_model) for sub_model in model.models]
        # Combine the sub-matrices into a single matrix
        combined_matrix = np.block([sub_matrices])
    else:
        # Compute the separability matrix for a single model
        combined_matrix = _compute_separability_matrix(model)

    return combined_matrix

def _compute_separability_matrix(model):
    """
    Helper function to compute the separability matrix for a single model.
    """
    if isinstance(model, SeparableModel):
        # For separable models, the separability matrix is diagonal
        n_inputs = len(model.inputs)
        n_outputs = len(model.outputs)
        return np.eye(n_inputs + n_outputs, dtype=bool)
    else:
        # For non-separable models, the separability matrix is all False
        n_params = model.n_params
        return np.zeros((n_params, n_params), dtype=bool)

class CompoundModel(Model):
    """
    A compound model that combines multiple sub-models.
    """
    def __init__(self, *models):
        self.models = models

    @property
    def inputs(self):
        return [model.inputs for model in self.models]

    @property
    def outputs(self):
        return [model.outputs for model in self.models]
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Recursive Handling**: The `separability_matrix` function now recursively computes the separability matrix for each sub-model if the model is a `CompoundModel`.
2. **Combining Matrices**: The sub-matrices are combined into a single matrix using `np.block`, which stacks the matrices appropriately.
3. **Helper Function**: A helper function `_compute_separability_matrix` is used to compute the separability matrix for a single model, handling both separable and non-separable models.

This should ensure that the separability matrix is correctly computed even when models are nested.

Understood. Please provide me with the specific changes or enhancements you would like to make to `astropy/modeling/separable.py`. If you can describe the issue or feature request in detail, that would be very helpful.
