#### #Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Hi.  
#### The SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my "order by" clause, because he "thinks" the clause was already "seen" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same.   
#### The bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:  
#### without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)  
#### The sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().  
#### As a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:  
#### sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\n'))  
#### without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)  
#### Note: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\r).  
#### Example of my query:  
#### 	return MyModel.objects.all().order_by(  
#### 		RawSQL('''  
#### 			case when status in ('accepted', 'verification')  
#### 				 then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),  
#### 		RawSQL('''  
#### 			case when status in ('accepted', 'verification')  
#### 				 then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)  
#### 				 else null end''', []).asc(),  
#### 		RawSQL('''  
#### 			case when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')  
#### 				 then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)  
#### 				 else null end''', []).desc())  
#### The ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:  
#### '				 then 2 else 1 end)'  
#### '				 else null end'  
#### '				 else null end'  
#### Second RawSQL with a				 else null end part is removed from query.  
#### The fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line.   
#### So in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases).   
#### The bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).  
#### Hope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.

To address the issue described in the GitHub issue, we need to modify the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method to handle multiline RawSQL expressions correctly. The suggested fix involves cleaning the SQL string of newline characters before processing it with the regular expression.

Here is the proposed change:

sqlcompiler.py
```
from django.db.models.sql.compiler import SQLCompiler

class CustomSQLCompiler(SQLCompiler):
    def get_order_by(self, sql):
        # Clean the SQL string of newline characters
        sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\n'))
        without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)
        return super().get_order_by(sql)

# Assuming the original SQLCompiler class is being extended or modified
```

To integrate this change, you need to ensure that the `CustomSQLCompiler` class is used instead of the default `SQLCompiler`. This might involve modifying the model's query compiler or overriding the compiler in your Django settings.

Additionally, if the `ordering_parts` regular expression needs to be adjusted to better handle multiline SQL, you might need to update it accordingly. However, based on the provided information, cleaning the SQL string should suffice.

Please review the changes and let me know if there are any further adjustments needed or if you have any questions!
