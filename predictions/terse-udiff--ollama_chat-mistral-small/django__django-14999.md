#### #RenameModel with db_table should be a noop.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### A RenameModel operation that already has db_table defined must be a noop.  
#### In Postgres, it drops and recreates foreign key constraints. In sqlite it recreates the table (as expected for a table renaming).

To address the issue where a `RenameModel` operation with a defined `db_table` should be a no-op (no operation), we need to modify the relevant parts of the codebase. Specifically, we need to check if the model already has a `db_table` attribute set and skip the renaming operation if it does.

I will assume that the relevant files are likely to be in the migration or model handling parts of the codebase. Since I don't have access to the actual file structure or content, I'll provide a general approach and example changes.

### Assumptions:
1. The `RenameModel` operation is defined in a file related to database migrations.
2. The `db_table` attribute is checked during the renaming process.

### Example Changes:

#### 1. Modify the `RenameModel` Operation

Let's assume the `RenameModel` operation is defined in a file called `migrations/operations.py`.

migrations/operations.py
```
from django.db import migrations, models

class RenameModel(migrations.Migration):

    def __init__(self, name=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name

    def state_forwards(self, app_label, state):
        pass  # Implementation details

    def database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):
        if hasattr(to_state.models[app_label], 'db_table'):
            return
        super().database_forwards(app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state)

    def database_backwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state):
        pass  # Implementation details

    def describe(self):
        pass  # Implementation details
```

### Explanation:
1. **Check for `db_table` Attribute**: Before performing the renaming operation, we check if the model in the `to_state` has a `db_table` attribute.
2. **Skip Operation if `db_table` is Set**: If the `db_table` attribute is set, we skip the renaming operation by returning early.

### Additional Considerations:
- Ensure that the `RenameModel` class is used correctly in your migration files.
- Test the changes thoroughly to ensure that the renaming operation behaves as expected when `db_table` is defined and when it is not.

> Allow creation of new file migrations/operations.py? yes
